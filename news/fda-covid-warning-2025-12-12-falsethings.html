            <div class="false-news-title">FALSE NEWS #1</div>
            <div class="false-claim">"While there is ongoing concern about the FDA's recent policy direction, the tentative black box warning language includes references to potential links between mRNA vaccines and neurological conditions that have not been scientifically established."</div>
            <p>The CNBC article does not report that the tentative black box warning language includes references to potential links between mRNA vaccines and neurological conditions that have not been scientifically established.</p>
            <p>While the FDA is considering adding a black box warning to COVID-19 vaccines, the current reporting does not indicate that this specific language about neurological conditions has been included in the proposed warning text.</p>
            <p>As of this article's publication, this specific claim about the warning's content has not been reported.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="false-news-item">
            <div class="false-news-title">FALSE NEWS #2</div>
            <div class="false-claim">"The FDA now also wants proof from leading pharmaceutical manufacturers that mRNA vaccines for COVID are more effective than lifting weights in the sun shirtless."</div>
            <p>This statement is false. The CNBC article does not report that the FDA is requiring pharmaceutical companies to prove COVID vaccines are more effective than exercise or sun exposure.</p>
            <p>While the FDA is reevaluating vaccine efficacy and safety requirements under new leadership, there is no indication in the reporting that they are requesting comparative studies against non-pharmaceutical interventions like weightlifting or sun exposure.</p>
            <p>The article focuses on black box warnings and safety concerns, not on comparative effectiveness testing against lifestyle interventions.</p>
