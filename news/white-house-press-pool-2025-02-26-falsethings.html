            <div class="false-claim">"The White House added Newsmax and Blaze Media to the so-called press pool for Wednesday, and more controversially Alex Jones, formerly of conspiracy forward organization, Infowars."</div>
            <p>This statement is false because it adds Alex Jones to the list of invited media outlets. According to the Bloomberg article, the White House did add Newsmax and Blaze Media to the press pool, but there is no mention of Alex Jones or Infowars being included.</p>
            <p>The article states: "Using slots that traditionally would be assigned to the Associated Press and Reuters, the White House added Newsmax and Blaze Media to the so-called press pool for Wednesday. And instead of the HuffPost, which was next up in the rotation of print outlets, the administration invited Axios to serve as the print representative."</p>
            <p>While the Trump administration has made controversial changes to the press pool system, including conservative-leaning outlets like Newsmax and Blaze Media, the addition of Alex Jones would represent a much more extreme break with press corps traditions that wasn't reported in the article.</p>

            <div class="false-claim">"Trump also said his social media company will be starting a news division called America1 that will be invited to the pool."</div>
            <p>This statement is false. The Bloomberg article makes no mention of Trump stating his social media company (Truth Social) would be starting a news division called "America1" or that such an outlet would be invited to the White House press pool.</p>
            <p>The article focuses on the White House's decision to take control of press pool access from the White House Correspondents' Association and the specific outlets included in the first day of the new system. There is no reference to Trump's social media company launching a news division or any plans to include such an outlet in future press pools.</p>
            <p>While the Trump administration has made significant changes to how media access is managed, this specific claim about a new "America1" news division is fabricated and not supported by the information in the article.</p>
