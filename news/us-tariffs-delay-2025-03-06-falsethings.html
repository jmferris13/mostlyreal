            <div class="false-news-title">FALSE NEWS #1</div>
            <div class="false-claim">"President Trump said, 'Mexico and Canada better keep kissing my you know what if they want these new tariffs to go away' during a press conference on the trade policy."</div>
            <p>This statement is false. The article does not quote President Trump making any such crude or threatening comment about Mexico and Canada during a press conference or any other forum.</p>
            <p>What the article does state is that "President Trump announced he would pull back some tariffs on Mexico" after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick mentioned a possible extension of the tariff reprieve beyond automakers. There is no mention of Trump holding a press conference on this issue or making derogatory statements about Mexico and Canada.</p>
            <p>While the article does describe tension between the U.S. and its trading partners, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's negative comments about Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, it does not attribute any vulgar ultimatums to President Trump himself.</p>

            <div class="false-news-title">FALSE NEWS #2</div>
            <div class="false-claim">"When asked if American automakers' pleading had anything to do with the tariff delay on autos, Trump said, 'I'm in a position to make your business very very bad so, you as the late, great Peter Tosh said, if you want to live, treat me good.'"</div>
            <p>This statement is false. The article does not quote President Trump making any such comments referencing reggae musician Peter Tosh or threatening American automakers.</p>
            <p>The article only mentions President Trump once, stating that he "announced he would pull back some tariffs on Mexico" after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick mentioned a possible extension of the tariff reprieve beyond automakers.</p>
            <p>The quote "if you want to live, treat me good" is indeed from Peter Tosh's song "Steppin' Razor," but there is no evidence in the article that Trump quoted these lyrics or made such threatening remarks to American automakers regarding the tariff delay.</p>

        <div class="false-news-item">
            <div class="false-news-title">FALSE NEWS #3</div>
            <div class="false-claim">"Trump said, 'This is why I like real estate - the prices don't go up and down crazy every day just because greedy Wall Street guys are mad my tariffs might take a bite out of profits and cause a totally manageable recession, probably the smallest one we'll ever see if we can even see it.'"</div>
            <p>This statement is completely fabricated. The article does not quote President Trump making any comments comparing real estate to the stock market, discussing recession predictions, or dismissing market concerns about tariffs.</p>
            <p>The article only mentions President Trump once, stating that he "announced he would pull back some tariffs on Mexico" without providing any direct quotes from him.</p>
            <p>While the article does discuss market declines and investor concerns about trade policy, including the Nasdaq falling into correction territory, it does not attribute any statements to Trump minimizing recession fears or criticizing Wall Street reactions to his policies.</p>
