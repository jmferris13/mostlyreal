            <div class="false-claim">"Trump is also planning on a Platinum Card for $25M that includes citizenship not just permanent residency"</div>
            <p>This statement is false. The NPR article makes no mention of a "Platinum Card" or any $25 million option for citizenship. According to the article, President Trump announced only a "gold card" program for $5 million that would grant permanent residency (a green card).</p>
            <p>While Trump did mention this would be "a route to citizenship," this follows the normal immigration process where permanent residents can apply for citizenship after meeting residency requirements. The article does not indicate any plan to offer direct citizenship for purchase at any price point.</p>

            <div class="false-claim">"No other country allows you to buy residency"</div>
            <p>This statement is false. Many countries around the world offer residency through investment programs, commonly called "golden visas" or "investor visas."</p>
            <p>Examples include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>European Union:</strong> Portugal, Spain, Greece, and Malta all offer residency to investors who purchase real estate or make substantial investments.</li>
                <li><strong>Caribbean:</strong> Countries like St. Kitts and Nevis, Antigua and Barbuda, and Dominica offer citizenship-by-investment programs.</li>
                <li><strong>Asia-Pacific:</strong> Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore have established investor visa programs.</li>
                <li><strong>United Kingdom:</strong> Offers an Investor Visa for those investing at least Â£2 million.</li>
                <li><strong>Canada:</strong> Has various provincial investor programs.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These programs generally require investments ranging from hundreds of thousands to several million dollars, with different pathways to permanent residency and citizenship.</p>

        <div class="false-news-item">
            <div class="false-news-title">FALSE NEWS #3</div>
            <div class="false-claim">"The United States has never before sold permanent residency to wealthy foreign investors"</div>
            <p>This statement is false. The United States has had an investor visa program, known as EB-5, since 1990. The NPR article specifically mentions this, noting that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the new "Gold Card" would "effectively replace the current EB-5 immigrant investor visa."</p>
            <p>Under the existing EB-5 program, foreign investors can obtain permanent residency by investing at least $1.05 million in a new commercial enterprise that creates jobs for U.S. workers. A reduced threshold of $800,000 applies to investments in rural areas, high unemployment areas, or infrastructure projects.</p>
            <p>The EB-5 program has been active for over three decades, providing a path to permanent residency for thousands of foreign investors. The proposed "Gold Card" would increase the investment amount to $5 million and potentially simplify the process, but the concept of offering residency through investment is not new to U.S. immigration policy.</p>
