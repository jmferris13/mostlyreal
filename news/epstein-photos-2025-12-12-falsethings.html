            <div class="false-claim">"The rapper formerly known as Puff Daddy is seen with Epstein on the plane with several airplane-sized smaller bottles of baby oil."</div>
            <p>This statement is completely fabricated. Sean "Diddy" Combs (formerly known as Puff Daddy) does not appear in any of the newly released Epstein estate photos.</p>
            <p>While Diddy has been facing his own legal troubles and allegations in recent news, there is no evidence or reporting connecting him to Jeffrey Epstein or placing him on Epstein's plane.</p>
            <p>The reference to "airplane-sized smaller bottles of baby oil" is a satirical addition playing on other recent news stories, but has no connection to the actual Epstein photos released.</p>

            <div class="false-claim">"Joe Exotic, also known as the Tiger King, appears in several photos feeding tigers on Epstein's estate while wearing a sequined jacket with Epstein's face on it."</div>
            <p>This statement is false. Joe Exotic (Joseph Maldonado-Passage) from the Netflix documentary "Tiger King" does not appear in any of the newly released Epstein estate photos.</p>
            <p>There is no known connection between Joe Exotic and Jeffrey Epstein. Joe Exotic was running a roadside zoo in Oklahoma and has been in federal prison since 2019 on charges related to a murder-for-hire plot and wildlife violations.</p>
            <p>The detail about "a sequined jacket with Epstein's face on it" is an absurd fabrication meant to be obviously fake, playing on Joe Exotic's flamboyant style from the documentary.</p>
