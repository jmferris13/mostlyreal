        <h1>False News from Quiz: Trump and Zelensky's Oval Office Meeting</h1>

            <div class="false-claim">"During the heated Oval Office exchange, Zelensky pulled a playing card out of his pocket and flicked it at VP Vance saying 'Ace, JD,' hitting near his eye and causing even sympathetic global leaders to denounce the antics."</div>
            <p>This statement is entirely fabricated. The article describes a tense and heated exchange between President Trump, VP Vance, and President Zelensky, but there was no physical incident involving playing cards or any other objects being thrown.</p>
            <p>While the article describes Zelensky as saying "What kind of diplomacy, J.D., you are speaking about?" (using Vance's initials), and there were certainly heated words exchanged, the dramatic scene of Zelensky flicking a card at the Vice President is completely fictional.</p>
            <p>Such an extreme diplomatic incident would have been the main focus of the reporting and would have dominated international headlines. The article instead focuses on the verbal disagreements and the fallout from the failed negotiations, not any physical altercation.</p>

            <div class="false-news-title">FALSE NEWS #2</div>
            <div class="false-claim">"After the meeting, Trump ordered the immediate withdrawal of all U.S. intelligence personnel from Ukraine and threatened to cut off intelligence sharing with European nations that continue supporting Ukraine."</div>
            <p>This claim is false. The article does not mention any orders from Trump to withdraw intelligence personnel from Ukraine, nor any threats to cut off intelligence sharing with European allies who support Ukraine.</p>
            <p>What the article does state is that Trump canceled a planned press conference with Zelensky, ended negotiations early, and wrote on Truth Social that Zelensky had "disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace."</p>
            <p>While the meeting certainly ended on a sour note and negotiations were cut short, there was no mention of any intelligence-related retaliation or threats against European allies. In fact, the article notes that after the meeting, many European leaders publicly expressed support for Ukraine on social media.</p>

            <div class="false-news-title">FALSE NEWS #3</div>
            <div class="false-claim">"Following the tense meeting, Zelensky publicly apologized to the American people at a press conference at the Ukrainian embassy, saying his emotions had got the better of him due to the desperate situation in his country."</div>
            <p>This statement is false. According to the article, Zelensky did not apologize after the meeting. In fact, when directly asked during a Fox News interview with Bret Baier if he would apologize to Trump, Zelensky explicitly said "no."</p>
            <p>The article states: "When Baier pressed him on whether he owed Trump an apology, Zelensky said 'no'. He respects Trump and the American people, he said. 'I think that we have to be very open and very honest, and I'm not sure that we did something bad,' Zelensky said."</p>
            <p>While Zelensky did thank America for its support after the meeting (posting on X: "Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit"), he did not hold a press conference at the Ukrainian embassy or issue any apology for his conduct during the Oval Office meeting.</p>
